The MatthewRigg2dAdventure game is a game made by Florida Polytechnic University student Matthew Rigg for Dr. Towle's Spring 2025 CAP4703.01 Computer Graphics course. The game comes with two files, main.html, which contains all of the source code for the game, and srcimgs, which is a folder containing all of the images that the game uses. In the game, you play as a Dwarven hero who seeks to become a master of Might and Magic through the slaying of monsters. This game is based off of the game "Might and Magic III: Isles of Terra" by New World Computing. All assets, with the exception of health potions, are either taken directly from the game or designed to look like things from the game.

Playing the Game:
You will need a JavaScript and HTML compiler to run the game.
To start the game, run the main.html file. 
Once the game has finished loading, you will be brought to the main screen, a green outdoor field surrounded by mountains.
To play the game, use WASD or the arrow keys to control the hero. the hero and the monsters each take turns moving.
To attack a monster, attempt to move on top of it. This will count as an attack, and the monster will lose an amount of health depending on its defense.
There are six monsters total; two BubbleMen, two MooseRats, and two CobraFiends.
BubbleMen are easy. They have low health, low defense, and low attack.
CobraFiends are more annoying than anything. They have low attack, but high health and defense.
MooseRats are the hardest. They have high health, defense, AND attack.
There are 2 health potions on the field which will restore the hero back up to max HP.
To win the game, you must kill all six monsters.
If the hero is killed, you lose.
GLHF!
